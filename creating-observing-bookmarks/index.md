# Creating Observing System Bookmarks

## Overview

An observing system bookmark is a set pair of instrument and facility codes that is easy to re-use and remember. If you decide to use an observing bookmark to reference a set pair of facility/instrument codes, you must exclude the Facility and Instrument keywords from the file.

To create an observing bookmark, use the "Tools" section of the menubar to search for and select a facility or instrument. Selecting a facility or instrument will reveal further details about that item. You will have the option at the bottom of this page to create a bookmark.

To use a bookmark, you must give it a nickname so that you can refer to it in your CSV file. Click on "My Bookmarks" in the menubar. Find the bookmark you wish to use and click the "Edit" button in the "Nickname" column. A nickname can be any simple string you choose and can contain letters, numbers, and spaces.

## Individual Steps

In this example, we will create a bookmark for an observing system using the observatory telescope as the starting point.

### Bringing up the search interface

The observatory search is accessible from the sidebar on the left-hand side of the window.
